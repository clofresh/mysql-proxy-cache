Dependencies:
 
 * MySQL Proxy (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-proxy/index.html) 0.8.2
 * Ehcache (http://ehcache.org/
 * LuaRocks (http://www.luarocks.org/) - to install the luasocket libraries
  * LuaSocket (http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~diego/professional/luasocket/)

Usage:

Assuming you have mysql and memcache instances running locally listening at their respective default ports, you can just run the following commands:

mysql-proxy --proxy-lua-script=mpc-ehcache.lua 

Then, point your application to mysql proxy on port 4040 instead of 3306. Make sure you specify 127.0.0.1 as the host instead of localhost, otherwise you won't connect to mysql proxy.

To control the cache, we use control strings in the query passed as comments

    /* CACHE: 30 */ SELECT * FROM table;
    
will cache the query for 30 seconds. Adjust the ttl value as needed

    /* FLUSH */ SELECT * FROM table;
    
will flush the cache for the query, but not actually process the query. You get a empty result set back

    /* REFRESH: 30 */ SELECT * FROM table;
    
will flush the cache and update the cache with the result for 30 seconds.

    /* HASH */ SELECT * FROM table;
    
Will return the calculated hash for the query

    /* ID */ SELECT * FROM table;
    
Will return the calculated cache id. We default to a different cache id per database, with a unset one using DEFAULT. This way we know for sure that the same query for two different databases will return the correct cache entries

    /* URL */ SELECT * FROM table
    
Will return the url we are using to cache the element.
