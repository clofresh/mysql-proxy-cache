This project is a database query caching layer written for usage by mysql-proxy. This allows transparent caching of queries without changing any code, just adding cache commands to the queries you care about.

We currently support two different engines. Memcached and Ehcache. Memcached is a fast, very well known solution, but only allows 250 byte keys. This means there is always a chance of a cache lookup returning incorrect data. The Ehcache engine uses the entire query string as the cache key, making it impossible to return incorrect hits.
